  "name": "Getting IMEI and Device ID",
  "description": "This app has code getting the \"device id (IMEI)\" (using `TelephonyManager.getDeviceId()` ) in order to identify the specific device. This approach has three major drawbacks: i) it is unusable on non-phones devices, ii) it persists across device data wipes, iii) it needs special privilege to be executed (`READ_PHONE_STATE` permission).",
  "remediation": "We suggest to use different ways of tracking app installations like relying on the \"Installation\" framework.",
  "references": {
    "text": "Further information on identifying apps installations and the \"Installation\" framework can be found in the Android Developers Blog [[1]].",
