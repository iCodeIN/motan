  "description": "The app does not configure the Network Request Whitelist options properly in its Cordova `config.xml` file. The Network Request Whitelist options control which network requests (e.g., images and XHRs) are allowed to be made. Cordova application includes `<access origin=\"*\">` by default.",
  "remediation": "Please restrict the network requests the app is allowed to make. To do that, the config file should restrict the domains and subdomains that can be accessed. If possible, the app is encouraged to use a Content Security Policy.",
