  "description": "Apps that store encryption keys without any protection parameter in a keystore accessible by other apps are vulnerable to information exposure. Keystore provides `setEntry` API to store a key entry. Along with the alias and the key, `setEntry` API takes an instance of `ProtectionParameter` as argument to protect the contents of the entry. If an entry is stored in a keystore with `null` as the `ProtectionParameter` argument to `setEntry` API, then any app with access to the keystore and aware of the alias can retrieve the entry.",
  "remediation": "Use a password-based implementation of `ProtectionParameter`.",
