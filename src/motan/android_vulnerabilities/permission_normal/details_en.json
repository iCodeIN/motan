  "name": "AndroidManifest Normal Protection Level of Custom Permission",
  "description": "At least one class declared in the Android Manifest is protected with a custom permission, declared with a \"normal\" or \"default\" permission level. This allows malicious apps to register and receive messages for this app.",
  "remediation": "Please make sure these permissions really need to be exported or otherwise change to \"signature\" or \"signatureOrSystem\" protection level. The `android:protectionLevel=\"signature\"` ensures that apps which request a permission must be signed with same certificate as the application that declared the permission. ",
