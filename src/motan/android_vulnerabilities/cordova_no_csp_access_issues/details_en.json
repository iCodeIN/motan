  "name": "Cordova CSP",
  "description": "The app does not include a Content Security Policy (CSP). The CSP controls which network requests (e.g., images and XHRs) are allowed to be made (via WebView directly). The CSP is a powerful feature since it allows the filtering of all types of requests that are not configurable using the Network Whitelist options (e.g., `<video>` & WebSockets are not blocked).",
  "remediation": "Please include a Content Security Policy in your app. Besides, the adding of Network Whitelist options are also encouraged.",
