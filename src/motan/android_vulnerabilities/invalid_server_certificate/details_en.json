  "name": "SSL Certificate Verification Checking",
  "description": "This app **DOES NOT** check the validation of SSL Certificates. It allows self-signed, expired or mismatch CN certificates for SSL connection. This is a critical vulnerability and allows attackers to do MitM attacks without your knowledge. If you are transmitting users' username or password, this sensitive information may be leaked.",
  "remediation": "Please remove the vulnerable code. Please do not try to create a `X509Certificate` and override `checkClientTrusted`, `checkServerTrusted`, and `getAcceptedIssuers` functions with blank implementations. We strongly suggest you use the existing API instead of creating your own `X509Certificate` class.",
