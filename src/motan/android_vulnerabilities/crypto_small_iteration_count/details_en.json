  "description": "An iteration count smaller than 1000 passed to `PBEParameterSpec` and `PBEKeySpec` constructors is insecure.",
  "remediation": "A minimum of 1000 iterations is recommended according to RFC 2898. This will increase the cost of exhaustive search for passwords significantly, without a noticeable impact in the cost of deriving individual keys.",
