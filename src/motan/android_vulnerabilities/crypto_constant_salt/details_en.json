  "name": "Constant salt for symmetric key derivation",
  "description": "If the salt being used is constant, then the symmetric key can be re-created by an attacker if the attacker has access to the password. An attacker can precompute a dictionary of symmetric keys for known passwords and use them to decrypt information.",
  "remediation": "Do not use a constant salt.",
