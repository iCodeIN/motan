  "description": "The app does not configure the Intent Whitelist options properly in its Cordova `config.xml` file. The Intent Whitelist options control which URLs the app is allowed to ask the system to open. By default, no external URLs are allowed. The loading of HTTP URLs or the inclusion of the wildcard filter is not recommended.",
  "remediation": "Please restrict the URLs the app is allowed to ask the system to open thereby specifying the allowed protocols (e.g., SMS, tel, or geo). Furthermore, the usage of plain HTTP filters is discouraged.",
