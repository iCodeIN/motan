  "name": "WebView Local File Access Attacks Checking",
  "description": "Found `setAllowFileAccess(true)` or not set (enabled by default) in WebView. The attackers could inject malicious script into WebView and exploit the opportunity to access local resources. ",
  "remediation": "This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling local file system access (which is enabled by default) by setting `yourWebView.getSettings().setAllowFileAccess(false)`. This precaution disables the file system access only. Assets and resources are still accessible using URIs, like `file:///android_asset` and `file:///android_res`. The attackers can still use method `yourWebView.loadUrl(\"file:///data/data/[your_package_name]/[file]\");` to access app's local file.",
