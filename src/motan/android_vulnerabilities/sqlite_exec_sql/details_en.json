  "name": "Potential SQL injection",
  "description": "Android allows apps to save data in a local database called SQLite. SQL queries are used to interact with the SQLite database. `execSQL()` method of SQLite allows developers to execute queries such as `INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE` which do not return any result. If an app uses inputs (e.g., user input via UI or data from web) to create a SQL statement to be executed via `execSQL()` method, then the app may be vulnerable to SQL injection attack.",
  "remediation": "Make sure to sanitize the inputs and use prepared statements if possible.",
  "references": {
    "text": "Further information on SQLite can be found in the official documentation [[1]].",
